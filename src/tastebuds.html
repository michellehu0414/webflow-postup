        Diners face challenges in confidently discovering dining options and making decisions due to

        "Why is it so hard to find a place to eat and trying new items? Despite convenient
        crowdsourced review apps such as Yelp and Google, why do diners struggle to make dining
        decisions efficiently?"
      </p>
      <p>
        These were the questions that guided me to explore the consumer dining experience. After
        witnessing shared challenges among my friends and family when it came to deciding where to
        eat and exploring new restaurants and menu items. As someone who values
        diverse culinary experiences and sees food as a gateway to understanding different cultures,
        I was deeply motivated to create a solution for the consumer dining space.

      <p>
        To address this problem, my research process followed the 5-stage Design Thinking model
        proposed by the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford (the "d. school").

                After collecting 20 survey responses, I organized the data in a spreadsheet to
                identify the most dissatisfied diners (displayed in 'Survey data and methods'
                tab).
                I conducted cross-data analysis, comparing the responses to uncover

                differences,
                and patterns. This process helped me identify potential correlations between
                various
                aspects of the dining experience and the levels of dissatisfaction.

                I measured individual user satisfaction levels based on several criteria:
                average
                time spent finding a place to eat, frequency of trying new restaurants,
                frequency of
                trying new dishes, and current methods used to make dining decisions. I then
                implemented
                a scoring system, assigning points to each satisfaction level: "Completely
                satisfied" received 5 points, while both "Completely dissatisfied" and "Mostly
                dissatisfied" received 0 points. Since there was only one data point
                for "Completely dissatisfied," I combined its score with "Mostly dissatisfied"
                to
                simplify calculations and maintain whole numbers in the ratings for clearer
                analysis.

              time
              spent on finding a place to eat, frequency of trying new restaurants, frequency of
              trying new dishes, and current methods to make dining decisions. Then I assigned a
              scoring system, where I assigned points to each satisfaction level, with
              "Completely
              satisfied" being 5 points and both "Completely dissatisfied" &amp; "Mostly
              dissatisfied" being 0 points. Due to having only one data point
              for "Completely dissatisfied," I combined its score with "Mostly dissatisfied" to
              simplify calculations and keep the ratings as whole numbers without decimals for a
              clearer analysis.

            Yelp excels in user-generated reviews, aiding informed dining decisions. However, its
            cluttered interface with excessive sponsored content overshadows this strength. Complex
            navigation, subpar above-the-fold design, and unclear CTAs hinder user experience,
            requiring extensive scrolling for essential information. Moreover, Yelp's open-ended

            Google Maps presents a clean and intuitive interface, simplifying restaurant searches
            and navigation. Its well-executed above-the-fold design and clear CTAs contribute to its

            the lack of filtering or sorting options might overwhelm users, potentially causing

        At this point, I realized that while my research had uncovered a lot about diners' problems,
        I still didn't fully grasp the big picture. To better understand my findings and how they
        relate to each other, I decided to make a mind map!

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="secondary-text">Diners lack confidence in decision-making, and existing methods are
        to blame.</p>
      <p>
        Increasingly <span class="fw-medium">commercialized content, lack of
          personalization</span>, inifinite search results, irrelevant and unreliable content cause
        decision paralysis and information overload. Consequently, diners struggle to confidently
        explore dining options and make informed decisions.

      <p>Additionally, I was able to answer my question from my secondary research:</p>
      <p class="secondary-text">Diners resort to online reviews because they're more accessible than
        word-of-mouth recommendations.

              I enjoy dining out because I can spend quality time with my friends and family, eat

              Like Alex, I enjoy discovery and spending quality time with friends and family, but I
              am more inclined to visit new, trendy places. However, unlike Brandon, convenience is
              not my priority if the place is worth visiting, so I'm more willing to travel for
              the experience! Also, dining out isn't limited to dining: As a remote worker, I like
              to work at aesthetic coffee shops with WiFi and outlets, so it’s important that
              restaurant provide high quality pictures and accurate, relevant
              information online.

        Given diners' habits with using mobile apps for decision-making, I decided that my product
        would also be a mobile application. To bring the diner stories I created to life, I
        brainstormed potential features, which I conceptualized into three potential
        routes using user flows. This process helped me begin visualizing how diners would interact
        with my product to enhance their dining experience!

            <p>To enhance personalization, search results are sorted by “% Match” by default. Using

            <p class="subheading">Saved search</p>
            <p>
              For convenience, similar to the concept of "Saved/Favorite orders" diners can add
              "Saved searches" to efficiently find dining options they seek often. For instance,
              since <span>Brandon</span> often works late, he might create
              a saved search called
              <span>"Late-night dinner"</span> with the following preferences: <span>previously
                visited, 0.5 mile radius”, “open until 12:00 AM”, and “offers takeout</span>. This
              would offer him a quick dining solution when pressed for time.

            <p class="subheading">Search results</p>
            <p>
              For both search options, diners would receive a <span>finite number of
                results</span>. <span>If dissatisfied</span> with the results, they can
              <span>refresh</span> the results, which they can only undo one previous set. This
              intends to <span>mitigate decision paralysis while encouraging diners to
                carefully consider their options without restricting >discovery</span>.

      <p class="subheading">A dedicated search page</p>
      <p class="mb-32">
        Most of the decision-making process for diners is comparative analysis. This intends to
        facilitate seamless navigation between restaurant listings and other pages for diners,
        optimizing their process by eliminating the need to switch between pages and
        losing the search progress!
      </p>
      <p class="subheading">New features ✨</p>
      <p>Since I was able to identify and address gaps in my user flows, I used my user personas to
        further empathize with my target diners and brainstorm more features that would enhance
        their experience. I added direct messaging, exclusive in-app
        offers, and saved reviews and restaurants.</p>
      <p class="subheading">Challenge 😵‍💫</p>
      <p>The most challenging aspect was deciding the placement of the social feed. Both
        personalized and word-of-mouth recommendations are valued by diners, making this
        prioritization difficult. Ultimately, I chose to display personalized recommendations
        first for their immediate value, while still ensuring easy access to word-of-mouth
        recommendations by placing them second on the navigation bar!</p>

                  by targeting specific ingredients in menu item description.

                  <br> After some research, I learned that this can be engineered using Yelp and
                  Google APIs. However, this idea was a key moment in my brainstorming phase because
                  this gave me the idea of integrating restaurants into the
                  mobile solution as users to update their information and menus. This also gave me
                  the idea for a business strategy to generate revenue from restaurant partnerships,

          struggled the most with the reviews page due to the amount of information I wanted to
          display. The wireframe I chose organizes essential information that prioritizes
          scannability and
          facilitates quick navigation to restaurant lists, menu items, as well as community
          engagement.
          <br>
          <br> This was the point I began to brainstorm the social aspect of the app, exploring how
          user engagement with friends' reviews could enhance tailored recommendations. I planned to
          develop these ideas further in my high-fidelity wireframes
          and implement them in my social feed page!
          <br>
          <br> The only other changes I made were restructuring the home page to display more
          essential information above the fold by displaying order recommendations in a carousel to
          enhance scannability.

        In crafting my color palette, <span>

        <br>At first, I heavily considered the color red, which is used by major competitors in the
        consumer dining industry, such as McDonald's, Doordash, Yelp, and Open Table, to stimulate
        appetite and spending. However, I realized that my mobile
        solution aims to leverage personal recommendations to build trust and confidence, not drive
        consumer spending. Therefore, <span>
          I chose a sunflower yellow to encourage social interaction and exploration, complemented
          by a sky blue to provide a sense of familiarity, as it is commonly used in interactive

      <p class="section-subheading">Methodology</p>
      <p>
        I recruited 5 diners to test out my high-fidelity prototype remotely and gather feedback. I
        sought out participants between the ages 21 and 30 who dine out at least once a week and use
        at least one online method to find dining options.
        Each test was moderated and included the following
        tasks:
      </p>
      <ol class="mb-32">
        <li>
          <span class="fw-medium">Route 1</span>: Create an account using your Facebook login.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="fw-medium">Route 2</span>: Find a restaurant to dine at within 3 miles of
          your current location.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="fw-medium">Route 3</span>: Write a 4.5-star review with a photo for Olives
          Branch Bistro, where you had a Mixed Kebab Plate.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="section-subheading">Findings</h3>
      <p>Overall, participants found the prototype very informative and intuitive! The most critical
        error occured during the onboarding flow, as most participants mistakened TasteBuds as a
        food ordering app. Nonetheless, they all highly prefer it over their current tools. I was
        pleased to confirm that my primary and secondary insights continue to be consistent. The
        visual aids were frequently affirmed in its impact on scanability, which they expressed
        significantly helped them complete the onboarding process. </p>

      <p class="section-subheading">Methodology</p>
      <p>For my final round of testing, I recruited 5 new participants that shared the same
        characteristics as the previous round and instructed the same set of tasks. My primary
        objective was to see if my iterations resolved the issues that occured during the previous
        test. I was also interested in seeing if there are any unintended use cases.</p>
      <p class="section-subheading">Affinity Mapping</p>
      <p>For this round of testing, I wanted to challenge myself and generate some quantitative data
        for my data synthesis. While 5 participants doesn't yield substantial data, I wanted to
        experiment with another tool and see if Notion could help me better identify patterns and
        themes via keywords. By the end of my data synthesis, I generated affinity maps for each
        route and organized the data using Notion's variety of view options.</p>
      <p>Here is an overview of my process:</p>

    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <p>With Notion's features, I was able to
        filter and arrange data to efficiently identify patterns. For example, using the count
        property, I could
        tally participants and sort data to visualize the most recurrent issues. The single-select
        and multi-select tags helped me pinpoint themes and locate specific data quickly, making the
        process much easier.</p>

        Overall, diners were impressed by TasteBuds! They praised the personalization features and
        how TasteBuds leverages word-of-mouth recommendations. My iterations resolved all previous
        errors. The only issue was that some users found nonessential parts of the review UI
        confusing. One diner said:

      <p>
        I know most if not all case studies don’t discuss their limitations, but as a designer with
        a degree in sociology, it feels wrong not to include them:
      </p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li>
          <span class="fw-medium">Observer Bias</span>: The presence of an observer during usability
          testing can influence participants' behavior or responses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="fw-medium">Limited Scope of Testing:</span> While I was only testing my red
          routes, . This became apparent when some participants deviated from the route. Therefore,
          I likely missed out on specific usability issues that
          could occur in other situations.<span class="fw-medium"><br /></span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="fw-medium">Difficulty Capturing Emotions and Attitudes: </span>My usability
          testing primarily focuses on observable behaviors and task completion, making it
          challenging to capture users' emotions or attitudes. Although
          I tried my best to extract insights through ample follow-up questions, as well as
          reminding users to think out loud, I was limited by time constraints.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="fw-medium">Designer Bias and Subjectivity: </span>As expressed earlier, my
          own biases as a user and an enthusiastic designer limited my perspective, which likely
          compromised the effectiveness of my tasks and limited my
          observations. Additionally, I inevitably interpreted test results subjectively, which led
          to overlooking behaviors due to preconceived biases, desire for validation, and
          anticipations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="fw-medium">Impact of Wording in Instructions: </span>Subtle changes in task
          wording led users to interpret them differently, requiring adjustments that might have
          compromised data consistency.

        What are limitations? Limitations in research are the boundaries or weaknesses that restrict
        its scope, reliability, or generalizability. They’re constraints that can hinder the study's
        ability to fully address certain aspects or make broad conclusions.
        Recognizing these limitations is important to understand the study's context and interpret
        its findings accurately. In other words, these are the reasons you should take my
        conclusions with at least an iota of salt!

      <p>If I had more time, I would optimize the prototype by eliminating non-essential features,
        ensuring design consistency across all user flows, and enhancing the UI for the review
        process. I would implement and test a thumbs up/down rating system and a summary of
        aggregate votes per
        restaurant quality in profiles. Additionally, I would identify and design for edge cases,
        such as empty states, non-restaurant partner profiles, and users who are the first to review
        a non-restaurant partner in their social circle. I’m also interested in retesting
        the review route to evaluate how diners review a recent dining experience in a real-world
        setting.</p>
      <p>If I could ship this with a team, I would prioritize refining the business strategy
        and develop a prototype for restaurant partners. This prototype would integrate restaurant
        partners into the user journey and optimize existing touchpoints based on insights
        from further research. We would conduct user interviews and surveys with restaurant owners,
        then refine and develop features that ensure seamless and
        intuitive interaction across the platform. The final round of testing indicates that
        features like gamification may not be
        essential for user engagement, but we would validate this hypothesis through further
        testing or post-beta launch analysis, considering its potential scalability
        benefits.

    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <p>
        This usability test taught me a lot about my design solutions and design thinking. I
        uncovered some of my most significant mistakes and weaknesses as a designer and as an
        individual that contributed to the issues:
      </p>
      <p class="section-subheading mb-8">Avoid overdesigning</p>
      <p>I was trying to please everyone—rookie mistake. This led to scope creep and caused
        information
        overload for users. </p>
      <p class="section-subheading mb-8">Mental models can change</p>
      <p>I was unnecessarily concerned about existing behaviors and mental
        models. I learned that people are willing to challenge and shift their mental models for
        compelling alternatives, especially for painkiller products (such as TasteBuds). After all,
        industry standards are always evolving. As a designer who values innovation, this was a
        critical and motivating lesson.</p>
      <p class="section-subheading mb-8">Iterate user flows</p>
      <p>I learned the importance of iterative user flows. While many designers create only one
        draft at the beginning, it's important to continue iterating, which also helps track
        iterations.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
    </header>
    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <p>As my first exposure to product and UX design, my inexperience led to several challenges
        throughout the project. The steep learning curve with Figma resulted in poor version
        control, and working independently without accountability and diverse perspectives led to
        significant scope creep. In hindsight, my major roadblocks stemmed from overdoing
        anticipatory design and UI design, further contributing to scope creep.
        <br><br>
        On the bright side, this case study highlighted the value of my background in sociological
        research and business development. My approach to user research and testing helped me
        navigate iterations and manage scope creep. While my business acumen aided in designing
        features that support my monetization strategy, it also contributed to scope creep.
        Fortunately, many of these additional features have the potential to be scalable in the
        future.
        <br><br>
        Moving forward, I plan to strengthen my skills in designing MVPs, improving version
        control, and balancing business objectives without causing scope creep. I also aim to rely
        more on user testing than anticipatory design to maximize time and resources. Overall,
        this was an incredibly rewarding experience. I learned to embrace criticism and unintended
        use cases as opportunities for innovation. Overall, this design journey established my core
        values as a designer: humility, innovation, and a constant drive for growth. I look forward
        to applying my new skills and
        knowledge to future projects!
