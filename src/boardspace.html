          Given the brief, we began our project by
          exploring the problem space. This was
          challenging due to constraints in time
          and resources. <span class="blue">Without existing user
            research or direct access to users, we
            relied on a combination of secondary
            research, competitive analysis, and an
            in-depth conversation with the CEO,
            Pat Crosscombe.</span> Pat shared
          valuable insights, including snippets of
          user feedback and personal anecdotes
          from her experience as a former
          non-profit board director.

        Throughout our design audit, we
        experienced significant cognitive
        overload and encountetext-red numerous
        errors, which we struggled to resolve.
        This was shaped by substantial gaps in

        <h2>Sketching</h2>
        <p>Using our new user flows, we proceeded
          to sketch new designs for each route. We
          each spent a day sketching our delegated
          screens, and I was tasked to sketch the
          home page.</p>

      <h3>Polls home page</h3>
      <div id="sketchesIntro">
        <div class="item">
          <p>My sketches prioritized the
            usability issues we identified in
            our design audit, which found the
            page disengaging and hard to scan. I
            sketched two different ways to view
            the board and two different
            information architecture, each with
            Call To Action (CTA) buttons and
            sort and filter options. To save
            time, I sketched a different
            information architecture strategy
            for each view.</p>

          <p>This IA organizes polls by their
            status (open/closed) and CTA. I added
            "tags" to integrate the feature into
            the horizontal tagging system. The top
            of each card is shaded differently
            across the subsections as a visual
            aid.</p>

          <p class="fw-medium">Table view</p>
          <p>This prioritizes user roles and their
            access permissions because only the
            owner can edit a poll and view results
            of an open poll. The hierarchy is
            based on my speculation incoming polls
            need more attention.

            Other changes are a colotext-red chip
            based
            on urgency, one flex-column for votes,
            a
            status chip, label copy changes, and
            relocating buttons in an ellipses icon

        <h2>Low-fidelity wireframes</h2>
        <p>This process was somewhat
          challenging
          because we faced several new,
          unexpected constraints. Scheduling a
          meeting with the developer proved
          difficult, which took place after we
          developed our wireframes. We learned
          there were limited handoff
          expectations and that the style
          guide
          was outdated, impacting the
          consistency of our designs. Learning
          about platform limitations and
          additional info about the poll
          feature
          at this meeting also set back our

          <h4>Polls home page</h4>
          <p>Before we created the high-fidelity
            prototype, we presented our
            low-fidelity
            wireframes to update our client on our
            design progress and gain feedback.
            For the most part, our client was
            happy
            with our designs. However, we faced

        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Gallery view</h4>
          <p>
            Our client pushed back on the gallery
            view, arguing that it’s too different
            from the rest of their pages. While I
            maintained that offering the
            flexibility can accommodate different
            visualization preferences among board
            directors, I omitted it from my
            designs. The ideas they pushed back on
            was displaying a gallery view and
            implementing the flex-column with the
            names
            of creators. They argued that it
            doesn’t matter who created the poll,
            that the most important information is
            their status.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, while I was designing our
            high-fidelity wireframes, I proceeded
            to keep the flex-column because I felt
            that
            it was necessary to meet the
            heuristics of system status clarity,
            navigation, and user control and
            flexibility. My assumption was that
            due to how only the creator of a poll
            may edit their poll and email
            reminders to respondents, it’s
            necessary to display the information
            to ensure that it’s easy to scan the
            page and locate their poll.

        <div>
          <h4>Displaying the creator of the
            poll</h4>
          <p>
            Upon reviewing our low-fidelity
            designs, our client they pushed back
            on was displaying the creator of the
            poll. They argued that it doesn’t
            matter who created the poll, that
            the most important information is
            their status.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I kept the flex-column
            because I
            felt that it was necessary to meet
            the heuristics of system status
            clarity, navigation, and user
            control and flexibility. My
            assumption was that due to how only
            the creator of a poll may edit their
            poll and email reminders to
            respondents, it’s necessary to
            display the information to ensure
            that it’s easy to scan the page and
            locate their poll, especially since
            those buttons are now hidden within
            an ellipses icon button.
          </p>
          <p> However, I did rearchitect the
            home page to simplify the
            organization and prioritize the
            critical information.</p>
