								Yelp excels in user-generated reviews, aiding informed
								dining decisions. However, its cluttered interface with
								excessive sponsored content overshadows this strength.
								Complex navigation, subpar above-the-fold design, and
								unclear CTAs hinder user experience, requiring extensive
								scrolling for essential information. Moreover, Yelp's
								open-ended review process may pose challenges in
								maintaining review quality.

								Google Maps presents a clean and intuitive interface,
								simplifying restaurant searches and navigation. Its
								well-executed above-the-fold design and clear CTAs
								contribute to its appeal. The structured review process
								aids in comprehensive feedback. However, the lack of
								filtering or sorting options might overwhelm users,
