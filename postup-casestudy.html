            PostUp is a new startup that allow freelancers and remote workers
            share tips, resources, and advice. Witnessing an uptick in feedback
            and discussions between users about finding good public places to
            work from, PostUp wants to create a better solution. create a
            subscription-based mobile app that addresses this trend for $5.99 a
            month. PostUp is a new startup that wants to make it easier for
            freelancers and remote workers to find great coffee shops and public
            spaces to do work from.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-32">
            With a modified Google Ventures (GV) design sprint, I aimed to
            design the mobile app for PostUp over a course of five days that
            helps remote workers quickly find suitable public workspaces,
            helping PostUp enhance its user experience while opening a new
            revenue stream.

            The PostUp mobile-app allows remote workers to locate nearby public
            spaces. Users may search locations by remote task, such as quiet
            work, meetings, and calls. Each public space has a comprehensive
            profile that displays details on essential work environments
            prioritized by remote workers, such as WiFi speed, restroom
            availability, noise-levels, table sizes, and more. Users have
            exclusive access reserve seating at partner locations that reserve
            seating for PostUp members and can see real-time updates on
            availability seating. All workspace details are generated by reviews
            posted by members.

            My design sprint adopts a modified version of Google Venture's (GV)
            design sprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a structured five-day process that rapidly solves critical
            business problems through design, prototyping, and testing ideas
            with users. Typically, a full-scale process involves a diverse team
            collaborating intensively in a series of exercises, such as mapping,
            sketching, and prototyping, to validate solutions quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project employs an adaptation that enables a solo designer to
            effectively carry out the streamlined process. Working
            independently, this process helped me quickly deliver a design and
            business solution to PostUp.

                I wish I had access to all interview recordings, notes, and
                transcripts. While standout quotes were helpful, the lack of
                research data prevented me from identifying and verifying
                trends.
              </p>
              <p>
                I usually merge qualitative and quantitative data, such as
                identifying trends by tracking frequent keywords, ranked by
                frequency.

            Based on my research insights, most remote workers shared the same
            needs, motivations, pain points, and characteristics. This led me to
            create a single persona to guide the rest of the sprint.

              this point, I decided allowing Nina to adjust filters before
              viewing results would offer a more streamlined experience,
              potentially saving her an extra step in their journey if her
              preferences align with the presets. Sometimes, removing just one

              With new inspiration, I moved forward with ideation by taking the
              "most critical screen" from my Crazy 8s and creating a 3-panel
              storyboard, mapping screens that achieve the most critical journey
              for remote workers.

                  The "most critical screen" is a specific interface screen
                  within an app or product that holds significant importance in
                  the user journey. This screen would later be incorporated into
                  a 3-panel storyboard, which would visualize the step before
                  and after the critical screen.

                  Among my Crazy 8s, I identified the "search results" sketch
                  (pictured at the center) as the most critical screen. This
                  screen takes the spotlight because itâs the central hub for
                  remote workers to compare and narrow down their options.

                <p>
                  I soon realized that the journey actually ends with settling

            This storyboard follows Nina's journey using PostUp in a new city.
            This was my first time designing a storyboard for UX design, as I've
            only developed storyboards for filmmaking! Using my past
            storyboarding experience for short films, I used a comic-style
            approach, which was incredibly helpful.

                Illustrating Nina's journey with this technique allowed me to
                better immerse myself in her perspective and gain a better
                understanding of her needs and emotions. Continuously asking
                questions like "How might Nina react here?" and "What actions
                might Nina take next?" helped me to identify important
                touchpoints. By the end of the process, I was able to develop
                and refine both user stories and flows in one sitting.

            With limited access to resources while traveling or on the go,
            remote workers in a new city potentially have greater needs compared
            to someone working in a familiar city. Therefore, I aimed to meet
            these needs to develop an adaptable and inclusive solution that
            accommodates diverse scenarios

                <p>
                  Being in a new city, Nina likely has little knowledge of her
                  surroundings, so she's probably keen to explore nearby
                  workspaces. Therefore, the ideal home screen should show Nina
                  a map that visually displays available options around her
                  current location.<br />

                  With a new 'Search' page, I was able to display the details on
                  the preset filters to ensure transparency. As for my conflict
                  regarding whether or not Nina should be able to adjust filters
                  immediately after task selection, after reviewing my user
                  research, I realized most people share the same preferences
                  across all tasks! Being taken to a filters page each time Nina
                  selects a preset could be counterproductive. She can also just
                  conduct a new search. Besides, testing may reveal the ideal
                  flow!

                  The final highlight of my storyboard evolution was adding a
                  'Reviews' section for each workspace. After Nina learns about
                  the workspace's details, she might want to see what other
                  people have to say or seek more details, especially since
                  that's what she's used to doing with her existing tools. For a
                  more intuitive experience, users may navigate between the
                  pages by swiping horizontally.

              By the end of Day 3, my vision for Nina's journey ended with
              selecting a workspace. On this day, I realized that the journey
              technically ends with settling down at the workspace.

                      pertinent info at first glance. The listing also focuses
                      on photos of the interior rather than food.<br />

              Prioritizing convenience and accessibility of workspace details
            </h4>
            <p>
              My initial design divided the listing page into two sections:
              'Details' and 'Reviews', navigable via a pagination bar for an
              intuitive experience. However, while prototyping I realized the
              pagination bar would sacrifice space for work environment details
              above the fold. I revisited user research and found remote workers
              mainly explore reviews in existing tools for workspace details due
              to mistrust of unreliable info. Recognizing the importance of
              accurate and accessible data, I adopted a single-page design that
              synthesizes workspace details submitted by other PostUp members.

              <h4>Stashed Features</h4>
            </header>
            <p>
              Due to time constraints, I couldn't design all potentially helpful
              features. With MVP design, I prioritized on solutions supported by
              strong evidence, excluding features with limited data. I felt
              comfortable doing this because I've learned that users often
              notice "missing" features and overlook unnecessary additions.
              Therefore, I planned to evaluate the need for the following
              features during testing and follow-up discussions:
            </p>
            <h5>Seating availability</h5>
            <p>
              Real-time seating availability was mentioned in user research, but
              only by one interviewee, lacking substantial data.
            </p>
            <h5>Reservation system</h5>
            <p>
              While seating reservation was not explicitly mentioned during user
              interviews, I speculated it would be helpful. However, due to the
              lack of seating reservation services across most coffee shops and
              libraries, I held off on implementing this feature.
            </p>
            <h5>Search bar in 'Discover' page</h5>
            <p>
              I didn't have enough time to prototype this alternative route, so
              I decided to prototype only one primary route and rely on testing
              to reveal alternative routes. My prototyped route at this point
              was navigating to the 'Search' page. However, I speculated that
              its location outside of home page ('Discover') compromised its
              visibility, thus accessibiilty. Scrolling through the map and
              searching via the search bar is the primary method across
              competitive products and is very straightforward, so I wanted to
              prioritze this route for testing.
            </p>
            <h5>Popular times</h5>
            <p>
              Displaying popular time was another solution I brainstormed.
              Similar to other pending features, it was not prototyped because
              no interviewees expressed a desire for it. However, IÂ speculated
              the need due to its presence in competitor products such as Google
              Maps, which I thought could be a user expectation. I speculated
              this would help further streamline the user flow.

            While this was very helpful as I tackled the screens, sadly, the
            dilemma I experienced on day 3 did not get fully resolved. I
            encountered a similar issue while trying to anticipate different
            user behaviors and potential alternate routes. Realizing I lacked
            sufficient time to cover them all, I decided against prototyping
            alternate routes and planned to rely on testing to reveal them.

              Overall, the feedback I received was overwhelmingly positive.
              Participants praised the user-friendly navigation, quick access to
              critical information, and visual design. They didn't find any
              critical information missing, but some suggested including
              additional helpful details that they don't find in their current
              methods, such as lighting and restroom capacity. Everyone
              completed their task very quickly and successfully.

              The only errors occurred were some confusion with the copy and

              included in this prototype are not typically found in other apps.

            <p>
              Based on the usability testing results, I brainstormed potential
              strategies aligned with the startup's requirement for a $5.99
              monthly user subscription fee to increase business revenue
              streams. My focus involves brainstorming new features that drive
              spaner engagement with businesses featured on PostUp, thus
              amplifying revenue generation. Considering the growing trend
              toward remote work, I see a promising opportunity for a mutually
              beneficial collaboration between PostUp and local businesses. This
              collaboration could incentivize businesses to enhance their
              amenities, catering to remote workers and in turn enriching the
              overall user experience for Postup subscribers. Therefore, I
              propose an

            <p>
              The primary challenge IÂ encountered revolved around adapting
              innovative solutions to user expectations, ensuring a seamless
              user experience. For instance, selecting icons for work
              environment amenities when many required icons don't exist in
              current products. Similarly, the challenge include crafting visual
              designs to convey novel information like labeling search results
              with distinct amenity icons, indicating 'available seats,' and
              identifying 'suitable tasks'. To overcome this, I relied on
              usability testing to reveal their expectations and iterated
              designs accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, I found myself occasionally dedicating excessive time to
              UI design, which contradicted the principles of an MVP-focused
              design sprint. To address this, I embraced time constraints and
              used rapid ideation techniques such as 'Crazy 8's' to accelerate
              and fine-tune my design process.
