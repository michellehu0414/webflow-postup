            PostUp is a new startup that allow freelancers and remote workers
            share tips and advice. Witnessing an uptick in feedback and
            discussions on how to find good public places to work from, PostUp
            wants to leverage this opportunity to create a subscription-based
            mobile app that addresses this trend for $5.99 a month.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-32">
            With a modified Google Ventures (GV) design sprint, I aimed to
            design the mobile app for PostUp over a course of five days that
            helps remote workers quickly find suitable public workspaces,
            helping PostUp enhance its user experience while opening a new
            revenue stream.

            This is a structured five-day process aimed at rapidly solving
            critical business problems through design, prototyping, and testing
            ideas with users. Typically, a full-scale process involves a diverse
            team collaborating intensively in a series of exercises, such as
            mapping, sketching, and prototyping, to validate solutions quickly.
            <br />
            <br />
            This project employs an adaptation that enables a solo designer to
            effectively carry out the streamlined process. Working
            independently, this process helped me quickly deliver a design and
            business solution to PostUp.

                      meeting clients or coworkers there, I want to be sure we
                      can get a place to sit and talk for a bit.

              this point, I decided allowing Nina to adjust filters before

              potentially saving her an extra step in their journey if her
              preferences align with the presets. Sometimes, removing just one

                      Being in a new city, Nina likely has little knowledge of
                      her surroundings, so she's probably keen to explore nearby
                      workspaces. Therefore, the ideal home screen should show
                      Nina a map that visually displays available options around
                      her current location.<br />

                    While developing this panel, I identified two key design
                    errors from day 1 and day 2. Initially, on day 1, I presumed
                    some users may need to adjust filters after selecting their
                    task for a more customized experience.<br />

                      <p>
                        Additionally, on day 2, the first panel in my 3-panel
                        storyboard depicted a filter page where users input
                        their tasks at the top but failed to show the
                        corresponding filters, potentially causing confusion.<br />

                      <p>
                        However, upon reviewing my user research, I realized
                        that most remote workers' share the same work
                        environment preferences, as remote tasks are not
                        particularly complex. Therefore, the filters I design
                        for each task are likely to align with most users'
                        preferences.<br />

                    To address these challenges, I implemented a revised search
                    approach for Nina by creating a separate search page that
                    provides two distinct methods:<br />

                Continuously asking questions like "How might Nina react here?"
                and "What actions would Nina take next?" enabled me to identify
                crucial touchpoints and refine user stories and flows!<br />

                I intentionally placed Nina in an unfamiliar city to help me

              <p>
                With limited access to resources while traveling or on the go,
                remote workers in a new city potentially have greater needs
                compared to someone working in a familiar city. Therefore, I
                aimed to meet these needs to develop an adaptable and inclusive
                solution that accommodates diverse scenarios

                At this point, my vision for the user journey ended with the
                remote worker deciding on a workspace to visit. Eventually, I
                realized that the user journey technically ends with settling
                down at a workspace.<br />

                        Being in a new city, Nina likely has little knowledge of
                        her surroundings, so she's probably keen to explore
                        nearby workspaces. Therefore, the ideal home screen
                        should show Nina a map that visually displays available
                        options around her current location.<br />

                      While developing this panel, I identified two key design
                      errors from day 1 and day 2. Initially, on day 1, I
                      presumed some users may need to adjust filters after
                      selecting their task for a more customized experience.<br />

                          Additionally, on day 2, the first panel in my 3-panel
                          storyboard depicted a filter page where users input
                          their tasks at the top but failed to show the
                          corresponding filters, potentially causing
                          confusion.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          However, upon reviewing my user research, I realized
                          that most remote workers' share the same work
                          environment preferences, as remote tasks are not
                          particularly complex. Therefore, the filters I design
                          for each task are likely to align with most users'
                          preferences.<br />

                      To address these challenges, I implemented a revised
                      search approach for Nina by creating a separate search
                      page that provides two distinct methods:<br />

              While this was very helpful as I tackled the screens, sadly, the
              dilemma I experienced on day 3 did not get fully resolved. I
              encountered a similar issue while trying to anticipate different
              user behaviors and potential alternate routes. Realizing I lacked
              sufficient time to cover them all, I decided against prototyping
              alternate routes and planned to rely on testing to reveal them.

                  setting), the type(s) of suitable work (quiet work, meetings,

                  engineering necessary would rely on Google Maps integration.
                  For more user control and freedom, this feature can be
                  adjusted by remote workers in search filters.

                <p>
                  Previously, my storyboard segmented the listing page into two
                  sectionsâdetails and reviews, which users can seamlessly
                  navigate with a pagination bar. This design aimed to
                  facilitate an intuitive and organized experience for remote
                  workers to navigate between the pages. However, when I was
                  designing the screen, I found that implementing the pagination
                  bar would sacrifice space for work environment details above
                  the fold. <br />To determine the more effective design
                  approach, I revisited my research for more insights into user
                  behaviors. I discovered that remote workers (1) primarily
                  explore reviews to learn about workspace amenities and (2)
                  rely on reviews due to mistrust shaped by past experiences
                  with inaccurate or unavailable information. This reinforced my
                  understanding on the criticality of accuracy and accessibility
                  of essential information. To draw more inspiration,
                  IÂ alsoÂ revisited my lightning demos of Airbnb's listing page,
                  which adopts a single-page design that places guest reviews in
                  the middle. <br />With these new insights, I reassessed my
                  design priorities and speculated that accurate information on
                  the work environment might reduce the need for remote workers
                  to evaluate the reviews. Therefore, I decided to forfeit the
                  pagination bar and opt for a single-page design.<br />

              Given the time constraints, I didn't have time to design the few
              features that could potentially be helpful. Moreover, IÂ wanted to
              avoid unnecessary features to adhere to MVPÂ design principles, so
              I decided to prioritize designs with overwhelming evidence and
              exclude any functionalities with low data points. In my
              experience, users are more likely to notice and express what's
              missing, and less likely to validate unnecessary features unless
              they contribute to negative usability experiences such as
              information overload. Therefore, I planned to rely on usability
              testing to assess the necessity for the following features:<br />
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheading">displaying seating availability</h3>
            <p>
              The participant interviewed during user research mentioned that
              information on seating availability would aid her search process.
              However, this was not presented in the user persona and the
              interviewed participant was the only user who expressed this
              desire.<br />
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheading">Implementing a reservation system</h3>
            <p>
              While a need for a reservation tool was not explicitly stated in
              user research, I speculated it would be helpful to address the
              similar need for displaying seating availability. Moreover, my
              exclusion is due to the lack of reservations for spaces like

              prototyping the search bar on the discover page
            </h3>
            <p>
              Usually, I prototype various routes for users to complete their
              user journey. However, given the time constraints, I decided to
              prototype only one route and rely on testing to reveal the primary
              and alternative routes. I speculated that the alternative primary
              route would search via the search bar placed at the top of the
              Discover page. My prototype at this point only designed the route
              for participants to search for options via "search by task"
              located only on the Search page. While IÂ designed this route to
              optimize the user flow, I speculated that its location outside of
              the Discover page compromised its accessibility, making it less
              likely the primary route.<br />

            <h3 class="subheading">displaying popular times</h3>
            <p>
              While the need for information on the trend in popular times of a
              workspace was not explicitly expressed in user research,
              IÂ speculated the need due to its presence in competitive products.
              I anticipated it being a user expectation shaped by competitor
              products like Google Maps. Moreover, given remote workers'
              preference for less crowded spaces, I believed in its potential to
              cater to enhance the user flow.<br />

                Before I began designing the screens, I created a new map and a
                list of features on paper.<br />

              <p>
                Given the hurdle I experienced the night prior and the time

                efficiently design my prototype.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                This was very helpful as I tackled the screens. However,
                unfortunately, the dilemma I experienced on day 3 did not get
                fully resolved. I encountered a similar issue while trying to
                anticipate different user behaviors and potential alternate
                routes. Realizing I lacked sufficient time to cover them all, I
                decided against prototyping alternate routes and planned to rely
                on testing to reveal them.<br />

              Overall, the feedback I received was overwhelmingly positive.
              Participants praised the user-friendly navigation, quick access to

              Based on the usability testing results, I brainstormed potential

              monthly user subscription fee to increase business revenue
              streams. My focus involves brainstorming new features that drive
              spaner engagement with businesses featured on PostUp, thus
              amplifying revenue generation. Considering the growing trend
              toward remote work, I see a promising opportunity for a mutually
              beneficial collaboration between PostUp and local businesses. This
              collaboration could incentivize businesses to enhance their
              amenities, catering to remote workers and in turn enriching the
              overall user experience for Postup subscribers. Therefore, I

              Overall, my strategies aim to increase client acquisition, boost
              conversion, drive app engagement, attract business partnerships,
              and establish a sustainable revenue model while enhancing the
              overall remote working experience throughout their user journey.
              In sum, these strategies offer additional revenue streams for
              PostUp while boosting the app's value proposition. <br />

            <p>
              The primary challenge IÂ encountered revolved around adapting
              innovative solutions to user expectations, ensuring a seamless
              user experience. For instance, selecting icons for work
              environment amenities when many required icons don't exist in
              current products. Similarly, the challenge include crafting visual
              designs to convey novel information like labeling search results
              with distinct amenity icons, indicating 'available seats,' and
              identifying 'suitable tasks'. To overcome this, I relied on
              usability testing to reveal their expectations and iterated
              designs accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, I found myself occasionally dedicating excessive time to
              UI design, which contradicted the principles of an MVP-focused
              design sprint. To address this, I embraced time constraints and
              used rapid ideation techniques such as 'Crazy 8's' to accelerate
              and fine-tune my design process.

                Throughout this project, I've expanded my insights into user
                behavior and expectations and honed my user experience
                principles in research, innovation, and business strategy. It
                reaffirmed my commitment to developing products that drive
                engagement and positive behavior change, enhancing the user
                experience and business revenue. As I progress in my role as a
                product designer, my grasp of user behavior and expectations has
                empowered me to anticipate their needs and maximize usability
                tests. This optimizes my design process, particularly my
                approach in creating user flows.

              <h4>Novelty and innovation</h4>
              <p>
                Designing PostUp gave me the opportunity to expand my prior case
                study on my previous project <em>TasteBuds</em>âa social
                recommendation mobile app that connects diners with trusted
                friends and personalized suggestions. This sprint validated my
                insights on user behavior and motivations from TasteBuds. Both
                studies underscore the importance of novelty and innovation to
                enhance user engagement and prioritize user-centricity.Â This
                experience definitely reinforced my commitment to research and
                anticipatory design, boosting my confidence in pursuing
                innovation! <br />

              <h4>Excess commercialization</h4>
              <p>
                In the current landscape of product design, there's a noticeable
                shift towards excessive commercialization, resulting in
                information overload that ultimately undermines the user
                experience. This design sprint has emphasized the importance of
                designing with both business and user needs in mind, ensuring
                that while maximizing business revenues, user-centricity remain
                at the core. <br />Designing PostUp gave me the opportunity to
                expand my prior case study on my previous project
                <em>TasteBuds</em>âa social recommendation mobile app that
                connects diners with trusted friends and personalized
                suggestions. This sprint validated my insights on user behavior
                and motivations from TasteBuds. Both studies underscore the
                importance of novelty and innovation to enhance user engagement
                and prioritize user-centricity.Â This experience definitely
                reinforced my commitment to research and anticipatory design,
                boosting my confidence in pursuing innovation! <br />

            All in all, this journey refined my identity as a product designer:
            I'm committed to leveraging MVP design principles and integrating
            research and forward-thinking, efficiently crafting experiences that
            meet user expectations while driving business growth through

            Using the usability testing insights, I plan to

            and
            <span class="semibold"
              >iterate screens for the rewards system, exclusive promotions, and
              reservation system</span

            to include <span class="semibold">reserving a table</span> and the
            final interaction with the appâ<span class="semibold"
              >earn PostUp points</span
            >
            in-store with an purchase at an official PostUp partner location. If
            I have more time, I would then conduct another round of usability
            testing to validaate my iterations.<br />

          <p>
            Finally, one of my long-term goals is to increasingly streamline my
            design process. IÂ aim to learn and develop efficient design
            strategies to streamline the product design cycle, maximizing
            company resources and reducing business costs. In other words, I
            want to
            <span class="semibold"
              >learn to design as efficiently as possible to cut down business
              costs and accelerate business growth</span
